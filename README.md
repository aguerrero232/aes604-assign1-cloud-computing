# Architecture

Site is developed with html and simple vanilla js

# Amazon S3 - object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets
All assets are stored on an AWS S3 bucket from the html files that let you view the site to the awesome higlights of me slaying noobs in call of duty.

### Buckets are stored in a specific region 
in this specific bucket's case it is stored in the **US East (Ohio)** us-east-2 region.
Data uploaded to the bucket as objects in Amazon S3. Each object has a key (or key name), which is the unique identifier for the object within the bucket.
